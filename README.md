# LeetCode Blind 75 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the LeetCode Blind 75 list. The goal is to enhance my understanding of data structures, practice their usage, and develop the ability to write optimal code rather than resorting to brute force solutions. The majority of the solutions are implemented in Go, but there are also some solutions in Python.

Feel free to explore the solutions and provide feedback. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm open to discussions and improvements.

## Repository Structure

- **Go Solutions:** Solutions implemented in Go programming language.
- **Python Solutions:** Solutions implemented in Python.

## How to Navigate

1. Browse the `Go` or `Python` directories based on your preferred programming language.
2. Each problem has its own dedicated folder with a clear naming convention.
3. Inside each folder, you'll find the solution file (usually named `solution.go` or `solution.py`) and any additional resources or notes.

## Contribution

If you have alternative solutions, optimizations, or better approaches, feel free to contribute! Open an issue or submit a pull request with your changes.

## Feedback

I welcome any feedback or questions you may have. If there's a particular problem you'd like more explanation on, let me know, and I'll do my best to assist.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
